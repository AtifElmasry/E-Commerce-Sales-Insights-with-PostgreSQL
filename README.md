# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Sales Insights with PostgreSQL

This project showcases my SQL and data analysis skills by simulating an e-commerce business database and uncovering key insights related to customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
I created this project to simulate real-world data problems and demonstrate how SQL can turn raw data into meaningful business insights. It showcases the kind of data analysis Iâ€™d bring to any data-driven team.
